			If you’re here, likely you (or someone you know) is having a hard time. You may be struggling with painful experiences, present difficulties, or a mental health disorder. If so, counseling is a great opportunity to get assistance.
		</p>
		<p>
			I’ve always been a listener and an encourager. While these are helpful, the work you will do in and outside of the counseling office is equally important. I strive to work with you to achieve your emotional and/or relational goals.
		</p>
		<p>
			If a relationship of yours is being affected, and your loved one wants to join you, I can help you identify each person’s needs and feelings, hear and be heard by one another, and solve problems together.
			</p>
			<p>
				I work with adult individuals and couples. If you’re ready to make positive changes or move toward a life you find more meaningful, please call me to set an appointment.
			</p>
			<p>
				I look forward to walking alongside you in this process of healing and wellness!
